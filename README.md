### About

_gatling_ is a GPU path tracer written in C. It's supposed to be a personal research project and learning experience.

Following papers and techniques are implemented:

- Compressed 8-wide BVH building and traversal [\[Ylitie et al. 2017\]](#user-content-ylitie-et-al-2017)
- Spatial splits in BVHs [\[Stich et al. 2009\]](#user-content-stich-et-al-2009)
- Range-based memory scheme for parallel spatial splitting [\[Gobbetti et al. 2016\]](#user-content-gobbetti-et-al-2016)
- SAH with Binning [\[Wald 2007\]](#user-content-wald-2007)
- Wavefront architecture with persistent threads [\[Laine et al. 2013\]](#user-content-laine-et-al-2013)
- Cross-platform memory mapping
- Uniform hemisphere sampling with lambertian BRDF

### Building

CMake 3.14+, a C11 compiler and Vulkan are required.

```
git clone https://github.com/pablode/gatling
mkdir gatling/build && cd gatling/build
cmake .. -Wno-dev -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . --target gp gatling
```

Before path tracing, an intermediate representation of the scene must be built using `gp`, _gatling_'s asset compiler:
```
./bin/gp cornell.glb scene.gsd \
    --image-width=1920 \
    --image-height=1080
```

Make sure there is a camera in the scene and at least one emissive surface. It is recommended to use glTF as the transmission format.  

Next, either disable the system's GPU watchdog or set an appropriate timeout value. For rendering, multiple optional arguments can be provided:
```
./bin/gatling scene.gsd render.png \
    --spp=256 \
    --max-bounces=4 \
    --rr-bounce-offset=3 \
    --rr-inv-min-term-prob=1.0
```

_gatling_ is optimized for my Pascal GTX 1060 GPU and will most likely not work on old or integrated GPUs.

### Outlook

The general idea is to follow Manuka's _Shade-before-Hit_ architecture with CPU dicing and GPU vertex pre-shading. Universal Scene Description (USD) will be the input format. A texture caching system with support for mip-mapping, compression and tiling is another major goal. [More...](https://github.com/pablode/gatling/projects)
